Code used in Mikkel Demsig's masters thesis. It contains code for checking the feasibility of multistationartity in the space of total concentrations for MAPK in the case n=3. The methods rely on theory in the articale "Multistationarity in the Space of Total Concentrations for Systems that Admit a Monomial Parametrization" by Conradi et. al, and for the theory on circuits chapter 4.5 in "Algebraic Methods for Biochemical Reaction Networks" by A. Dickenstein and E. Feliu. 
Supervised by E. Feliu and N. Kaihnsa at the University of Copenhagen, Institute for Mathematical sciences.
